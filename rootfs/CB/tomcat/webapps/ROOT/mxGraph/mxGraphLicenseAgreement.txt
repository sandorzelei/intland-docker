Dear Madam/Sir,

We would like to integrate "mxgraph" into our commercial application called "codeBeamer" (https://intland.com/application-lifecycle-management/).

Evaluators and customers can download and install our product on their (one or more) computers.

We would like to ship "mxgraph" with our product thus the customers don't have to install "mxgraph" additionally.

What are the conditions? The license description under the URL below is not clear for us:
